# Linked-List Demo in Rust

This repo demostrates linked list in Rust.  The implementation utilizes unsafe pointer due to the limiting feature of Rust compiler.  Many online demos of linked list in Rust didn't implement deleting related methods; therefore, I tried my own.  See [this post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2mrbhg/linked_list_generics_problem_unsafe_with_raw/) for original implementation.
